# Problem Statement

Extracting keywords from text document by applying TF-IDF method.

# Content

- Notebook1: using bag of word + TFIDF
- Notebook2: applying tfidf and getting results evaluated titles, abstract, main text.
- Notebook3: Keeping TFIDF as main method but, Other techniques such as gensim TextRank summarization,RAKE(Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction) ,Yet Another Keyword Extractor (Yake) ,python-based keyphrase extraction (pke), were explored.

# TF-IDF

TF-IDF stands for term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency, a formula that measures how important a word is to a document in a collection of documents.

This metric calculates the number of times a word appears in a text (term frequency) and compares it with the inverse document frequency (how rare or common that word is in the entire data set).

Multiplying these two quantities provides the TF-IDF score of a word in a document. The higher the score is, the more relevant the word is to the document.
