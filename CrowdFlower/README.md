# Problem Statement

Analysis of sentiments coming from tweets. These tweets are related to self-driving vehicles. Instead of positive, negative analysis, I have chosen to define Beneficial/Risky as labeling feature.

# Data Collection
Using aws Sagemaker Ground Truth tool, we labelled data as beneficial, risky, or neutral sentiments.
