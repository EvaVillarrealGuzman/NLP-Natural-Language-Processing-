# Dataset

This is a dataset taken from a paper from group to individual labels using deep features. This contains 1000 reviews and for each of the review, we have the real results as 0 or 1.<br>
0=Negative review, 1=Positive Review

# Problem Statement

We need to find how text in dataset is related with negative or positive reviews.There is no numerical data so, we cannot directly draw correlation plot. Therefore, we need to see how text is related to review and how customers rate, what are those words that express satisfaction of customers, how could we use this to predict review results of future value. Hence we need to prepare a model using Natural language processing (NLP)
