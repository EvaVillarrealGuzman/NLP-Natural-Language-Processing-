# Problem Statement

We will find technological trajectories in transport industry. Our case includes Electric Vehciles, Hybrid Electric Vehciles, Fuel Combusion Electric Vehicle, and Combusion engines. We have extracted patent data from PATSTAT (years 1990-2018).

# Method

This study will use topic modeling technique to find label for upcoming technologies and how we may inspect between saturted, convergent, or emerging technology in automotive industry.

# Modules
gensim <br>
pandas<br>
numpy<br>
re<br>
matplotlib<br>
seaborn<br>
bokeh<br>
plotly<br>
nltk<br>
spacy<br>

# Results

From our analysis, we have found 8 most optimal topics which are 

### Label data
- Topic 0:Plug-in Modules/ automotive connectors
- Topic 1: Automotive Disk Brake
- Topi 2: exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system
- Topic 3: Battery management system
- Topic 4: electronic security system in vehicles
- Topic 5: Engine Emission Control,
- Topic 6: electric vehicle charging station
- Topic 7:fuel cell technology

In next excercise, we will see how we could determine if these topics and their given technologies are emerging, convergent, or saturdated technology. We will also use network analysis to predict path of technology change in next 5 years. Stay tunned !!!
