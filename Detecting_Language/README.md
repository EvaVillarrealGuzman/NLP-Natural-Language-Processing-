Aim of this project is to detect programming language from stack overflow dataset given by Kaggle.

It is an implementation of Information retrival. I have taken "Go" as case language. The reason is that "Go" can be used for many other meaings than a programming language. So challenge is to figure out correct entity as of "Go" in only programming context.

# Content

- Notebook 1 contains code while we are retrieving one programming language i.e go using text data
- Notebook 2 contains code while we are using multi-token for programming language i.e Objective-C++ (there are 4 tokens). Also this notebook contains code for more than one programming language i.e ruby, python, c, js etc.
