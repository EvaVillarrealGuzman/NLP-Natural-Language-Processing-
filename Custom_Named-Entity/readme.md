# Problem Statement

We aim to extract key information from text data. Information is in form of entities.

# Solution

For this, we need to create customized Entity Ruler pipelines using pre-trained Spacy model

# Results

We have used visualization for showing outcome of our model by using Displacy. 

# Evaluation

For evaluating our mode, we have used beam confidence score.
